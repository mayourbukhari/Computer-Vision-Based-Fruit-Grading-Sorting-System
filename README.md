# Computer Vision Based Fruit Grading & Sorting System

This is a Industry grade setup that can be easily replicated. This repository not only includes the code for the system but also the trained model, the actual physical design and specfications in which we had implemented it, also the KiCAD design files of PCB, Xilinx FPGA architecture files and everything that can help you replicate it or design your own.



## Tech Stack

**Hardware:** JetSon Nano, Arduino Mega, Arduino Nano, PynQ Z2 FPGA, Servo Motors, Stepper Motors, Linear DC Actuator, Ultrasonic Sensor, RPi Camera, Optical Switches

**Software:** Python, Embedded C, Nextion HMI, Xilinx Vivado, Linux


## Documentation
This file includes the whole blueprint of the the project, with details on how to put everything together. This document was submitted by us as the Project Report for the Degree of Electronics and Communication Engineering in year 2023
