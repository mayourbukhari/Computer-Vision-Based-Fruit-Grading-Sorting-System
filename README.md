# Computer-Vision-Based-Fruit-Grading-Sorting-System
This is a Industry grade setup that can be easily replicated. This repository not only includes the code for the system but also the trained model, the actual physical design and specfications in which we had implemented it, also the KiCAD design files of PCB, Xilinx FPGA architecture files and everything that can help you replicate it or design your own.
